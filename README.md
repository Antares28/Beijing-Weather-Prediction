# Beijing-Weather-Prediction
We use data crawling to get weather data in Beijing. For the data processing part, we use pandas and numpy. Matplotlib is implemented for data visualization. Sklearn is used for air condition prediction based on ML models. 
Based on the historical weather data and air condition data, we try to predict the air condition level for the present. We compare two algorithms, and finally, we choose the optimal algorithm and finish the fine-tuning process of hyperparameters.
